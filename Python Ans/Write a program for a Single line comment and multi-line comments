Python, single-line comments are denoted by the # symbol, while multi-line comments are typically enclosed within triple quotes """ """. However, multi-line comments are not treated as comments by the Python interpreter, but rather as string literals.

# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This is another single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines,
but it's actually a string literal.
"""
print("Python is awesome!")


In the above code:

Lines starting with # are single-line comments.
Comments after code on the same line are also single-line comments.
The text enclosed within triple quotes """ """ is considered a multi-line string literal, which can serve a similar purpose to multi-line comments but won't be ignored by the interpreter.
